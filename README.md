# Predicting probability of defaul

## Workflow

- Model training
- Generate predictions
- Deploy the model to AWS using SageMaker

## Pre-requisites

* **python3.8**
* **aws-cli**

## Submissions
1. A verbose explanation of the model training and validation could be found [here](model_explanation.md).
2. CSV file with resulting predictions could be found [here](data/submission.csv).

## Steps

### Model training (`/Model.ipynb`)
1. Read and explore dataset (excluded from the current repo due to privacy reasons)
2. Train baseline defualt prediction model
3. Evaluate and —Åompare different models (Logistic Regression and Tree-based ensemble models) with a set of metrics
4. Estimate feature inportance
5. Generate predictions (`/data/submission.csv`)
6. Dump the best estimator (`/pickled_model.pickle`)

### Model deployment (`sagemaker/AWS - SageMaker.ipynb`)
1. Define Sagemaker session and role
2. Preprocessing data and train the model
3. Create SageMaker Scikit Estimator
4. Batch transform training data
5. Fit a Tree-based Model with the preprocessed data
6. Serial Inference Pipeline with Scikit preprocessor and classifier
7. Deploy model
8. Make a request to the pipeline endpoint

### API Gateway endpoint exposing
Besides AWS SageMaker I tested some other AWS deployment options including AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).
It allows deploing ML models with Serverless API (AWS Lambda). 
I managed to expose API endpoint with `helloworld` application behind in order to try AWS Lambda.

#### Used technologies
- ECR: Container & Registy
- AWS Lambda: Serving API
- SAM: Serverless Framework

#### Query the endpoint
GET request:
```
https://x3jp27x3t3.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/test/hello
```
Expected response:
```
{
    "message": "hello world"
}
```
